# README: Grail
Grail is a transparent, spec-driven wrapper around the Monty runtime that lets you write `.pym` scripts with declarative externals and inputs.

This repository contains Grail v3, which ships with improved validation, a structured logging/event system, and a simplified API (`load`, `run`, `run_sync`, `ScriptEvent`).
